#summary how to test controllers requiring DB connections

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

This class serves as a super class for controller tests requiring database connections. In effect, this class combines the logic of ControllerSpec and [DBSpec].
When it comes to naming convention of a controller to be tested, the functionality is identical that of ControllerSpec, but at the same time it will open a connection to DB before test and close after (will also roll back transaction)
