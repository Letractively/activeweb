#summary use AppIntegrationSpec to include filters into test lifecycle

= AppIntegrationSpec - includes ControllerFilters into test  =

!AppIntegrationSpec is a class that will bootstrap entire application, complete with ControllerFilters. The only difference of running your application under !AppIntegrationSpec and running it live, is that the [DBConnectionFilter] is disabled, and instead database connection is provided exactly the same way as in [DBSpec], [DBControllerSpec] or [DBIntegrationSpec].

In other words, think of !AppIntegrationSpec as the same with [DBIntegrationSpec], but all filters will trigger as in a real application.
