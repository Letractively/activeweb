#summary ActiveWeb promotes TDD/BDD with convenient APIs

= TDD with !ActiveWeb =

!ActiveWeb shines when it comes to testing. Specifically, it promotes TDD/BDD approach to testing of wen applications. At the heart, it uses [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] as a testing framework, but it provides a number of test classes to be sub-classed for  various purposes. !ActiveWeb allows to do a full test of any web functionality during a regular build. There are total 6 classes that serve as super-classes for various tests:

  * [DBSpec] - for testing any code requiring a DB connection
  * ControllerSpec - for testing a single controller
  * [DBControllerSpec] - for testing a single controller requiring DB connection
  * IntegrationSpec - for testing more than one controller
  * [DBIntegrationSpec] - for testing more than one controller at least one of which requires a DB connection
  * AppIntegrationSpec - for testing more than one controller, with DB connection and with all filters bootstrapped as in a real application.

This collection of super classes allows to write very thorough set of tests covering application functionality
