#summary ActiveWeb promotes TDD/BDD with convenient APIs

= TDD with !ActiveWeb =

!ActiveWeb shines when it comes to testing. Specifically, it promotes TDD/BDD approach to testing of wen applications. At the heart, it uses [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] as a testing framework, but it provides a number of test classes to be sub-classed for  various purposes. !ActiveWeb allows to do a full test of any web functionality during a regular build. !ActiveWeb provides a number of classes for testing.


=DBSpec for database tests=

DBSpec is a super class for tests which require a database connection. It is integrated with !ActiveWeb configuration and will automatically open and close a database connection before and after a test respectively. 
It is customary for !ActiveWeb projects to use a database for testing that is different than the one that is used for running the project live even on a developers workstation. This makers it easy to preserve data in place in the "development" database, and still use the full power of database CRUD access to your test database. For example, you could have some user data in a development databas which will allow you to log in, and perform other operations, and yet you can run test logic against your test database, destroy and re-create any data in it, without having to destroy your development database.

===Configuration===
Database configuration is described on DatabaseConfiguration page. DBSpec class will look for connections configured with a method `testing()`. Example taken from DatabaseConfiguration page:

{{{
 1. public class DbConfig extends AbstractDBConfig {
 2.  public void init(AppContext context) {
 3.      environment("development").jndi("jdbc/kitchensink_development");
 4.      environment("development").testing().jdbc("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://localhost/kitchensink_development", "root", "****");
 5.      environment("hudson").testing().jdbc("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://172.30.64.31/kitchensink_hudson", "root", "****");
 6.      environment("production").jndi("jdbc/kitchensink_production");
 7.  }
 8.}
}}}

Specifically, line 4 configures a test connection to be used during the test.
In case you work with multiple databases, you can configure more than one test connection. DBSpec will open all connections marked for tests.

==Transaction management==

DBSpec will  start a transaction before the test and roll it back after the test, ensuring integrity of data in a test database, and also that different tests would not affect one another by modifying data in the database. 

== Example of a DBSpec test ==

Lets say we are developing a blog, and we need to persist a post. A post will have title, content and author. All these attributes are required. A test will look like this then:

{{{
public class PostSpec extends DBSpec {
    @Test
    public void shouldValidateRequiredAttributes(){
        Post post = new Post();
        a(post).shouldNotBe("valid");
        a(post.errors().get("author")).shouldBeEqual("Author must be provided");
        post.set("title", "fake title", "author", "fake author", "content", "fake content");
        a(post).shouldBe("valid");
        post.save();
        a(Post.count()).shouldBeEqual(1);
    }
}
}}}


technically speaking you can use it for any test requiring a connection, but it also easy to use for Model tests. Model tests are tests for ActiveJDBC models. In case you use Hibernate or another persistence framework, you will have to setup connections in a different way.


Here is an example of a model we are testing:
{{{
public class Post extends Model {
    static {
        validatePresenceOf("title", "content");
        validatePresenceOf("author").message("Author must be provided");
    }
}
}}} 






  * ControllerSpec - for testing a single controller
  * [DBControllerSpec] - for testing a single controller requiring DB connection
  * IntegrationSpec - for testing more than one controller
  * [DBIntegrationSpec] - for testing more than one controller at least one of which requires a DB connection
  * AppIntegrationSpec - for testing more than one controller, with DB connection and with all filters bootstrapped as in a real application.

This collection of super classes allows to write very thorough set of tests covering application functionality
