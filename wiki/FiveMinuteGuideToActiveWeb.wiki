#summary 5 minute guide and the simplest dynamic ActiveWeb application

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

At the heart of an !ActiveWeb application is a controller. A controller is a component whose role is to accept and process an HTTP request. This is similar to a Servlet, or a controller class in SpringMVC, Action class in Struts 1 or a controller in Ruby on Rails.

Here is an example of the simplest controller:

{{{
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){}
}
}}}

==URL mapping convention==
Controllers are automatically mapped to a URL, such that a controller name is underscored (without the word Controller). Here is an example: 
{{{
http://localhost:8080/testapp/greeting
}}}

When this URL is accessed, the `GreetingController` is executed. Since no further information is provided on the URL, the `index()` method will be processed. Controller methods processed as a result of an HTTP request are called *actions*.

==Action mapping convention==
If the URL contained more information, let's say:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/testapp/greeting/hello
}}}
then the system would expect that the controller would have a "hello" action, as in:
{{{
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void hello(){}
}
}}}

However, as in the previous example, the action is omitted, which causes the framework to fall back on a default action "index".


==View mapping convention==

In this case, the action `index` does not have any code, the framework will pass control to a view. This view will be looked for under:
{{{
/WEB-INF/views/greeting/index.ftl
}}}

Where `/WEB-INF/views/` is a base location for all views, directory "greeting" is named after controller, and a view template "index" is called to render because action "index" of the controller was executed. The content of the `index.ftl` will be displayed in browser.


=Example passing data to view=
In the graphic below, you see how !ActiveWeb routes the request to `GreetingController` and action "hello".
The complete sequence of operations: 

  # A URL `http://localhost:8080/simple-example/greeting/hello?name=Bob` is entered into the browser. 
  # The Framework upon receiving the request, routes it to the controller !GreetingController, action "hello".  The controller passes some data to view - "date" as internally generated data, as well as "name" - HTTP request parameter, accessed with `param("name")` method
  # The Framework then passes the data to a view template `WEB-INF/views/greeting/hello.ftl` for rendering

In this example, the code you see on the image above is all that there is. There are no XML files, no property or any other configuration files.
