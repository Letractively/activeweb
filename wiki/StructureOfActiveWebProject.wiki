#summary learn about the structure of ActiveWeb project

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />


= Introduction =

!ActiveWeb is a Maven project, and as such has all the usual Maven conventions. This allows developers to become productive quickly, since locations of artifacts is the same as for a typical Maven Web. 

However, there are some specifics regarding !ActiveWeb, which are discussed below.

=Configuration=

In the image above, you can see that the there is a package `app.config`. This package contains 2 - 3 classes responsible for configuration of your project. !ActiveWeb does not have property files, XML or any other text based files for configuration. In fact, it barely has any configuration. Most configuration of the application is dealing with configuring database connections.For more on configuration, see here: [Configuration]


= Location of controllers =

Controllers are _always_ located in a package `app.controllers`. At first this looks strange, and uncomfortable, but this is a requirement of the framework and a general convention. Developers after a while get used to and start to appreciate it.  A controller is a Web component, and as such is not a subject of sharing across multiple applications. This means that controllers of one web applications will not intermingle with controllers of another. 
This approach yields the following benefits:
  * !ActiveWeb application structure is identical from one project to another, making it easier to onboard new developers
  * Controllers are compiled on the fly and reloaded on every request in development mode. This provides for unprecedented speed of development

= Location of models=

!ActiveWeb has a good integration with [http://code.google.com/p/activejdbc/ ActiveJDBC], and the `app.models` package is for ActiveJDBC models. However, while this is a convention and a recommendation, there is no hard requirement on the part of framework o keep models in this package or even in this module. 
For instance, in some of our projects, we keep models in a different shared module so that we can share a DB layer access across multiple projects. 

=Location of services=
The package `app.services` is a mere suggestion where they need to be located. If a service is not shared across many projects, it makes sense to place it into this package. If a service is used in other places, it migth actually be in a completely different module.

=Location of views=
!ActiveWeb uses (currently) [http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/ FreeMarker] for rendering and does not use JSPs. For reasons on this decision, please refer to  the [FAQ].
The !FreeMarker templates are located in directory `src/main/webapp/.WEB-INF/views`. 
The subdirectories indicate controller names. 

In an example above, there are three directories under `WEB-INF/views`: books, layouts and system

  * `books` is a directory specific to this small example project. It hosts templates for `BooksController`
  * `system` is a directory provided by !ActiveWeb. It contains two templates which are used by framework. Application developers are free to customize these according to the look and feel of the website.
    * The `404.ftl` is rendered when a resource not found (no controller, or action, or template)
    * the `system.ftl` us used when there is an internal system error (exceptions in controllers, etc.).
  * `layouts` is a directory to hold default and other layouts. The default layout is called `default_layout.ftl` and is invoked automatically by default (wraps every page into a layout)
