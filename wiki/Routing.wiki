#summary learn ActiveWeb routing
=Introduction =

Routing in !ActiveWeb is an act of matching an incoming request URL to a controller and action. Current implementation supports built-in standard routing and built-in REST - based routing. 

==Standard routing==

NOTE: the "context" in all URIs is a web application context, which is usually a WAR file name.


|| *path*                                  || *controller*                || *action*           ||  *id*||
|| /context/books                          || app.controllers.!BooksController     || index            ||  ||
|| /context/books/save                     || app.controllers.!BooksController     || save             ||   ||
|| /context/books/save/123                 || app.controllers.!BooksController     || save             ||  123||

In standard routing, the HTTP method is not considered, but you might get an exception of you send an HTTP method to an action that is configured for a different HTTP method. Routing and action HTTP methods are independent in case of standard routing.
For standard routing, there is no need to do anything, it works by default


==RESTful routing==
In case of restful routing, the actions are pre-configured. RESTful routing is configured by placing a @RESTfull annotation on a controller. For more informaiton, see: [ControllerExplained#RESTful_controllers]

||*HTTP method*  ||  *path*                  || *controller*                       ||   *action*       ||   *used for* ||
||GET          ||   /books               || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   index        ||   display a list of all books||
||GET          ||   /books/new_form      || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   new_form     ||   return an HTML form for creating a new book||
||POST         ||   /books               || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   create       ||   create a new book||
||GET          ||   /books/id            || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   show         ||   display a specific book||
||GET          ||   /books/id/edit_form  || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   edit_form    ||   return an HTML form for editing a books||
||PUT          ||   /books/id            || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   update       ||   update a specific book||
||DELETE       ||   /books/id            || app.controllers.!BooksController  ||   destroy      ||   delete a specific book||


==Routing with packages==

While `app.controllers` is a default package for controllers, you might want to organize them into sub-packages. These sub-packages can only be children of `app.controllers` package though. In case a controller is located in a sub-packages, the path mapping would also include sub-package names:

Standard routing

|| *path*                                      || *controller*                                  || *action*           ||  *id*||
|| /context/package1/books                   || app.controllers.package1.!BooksController              || index            ||     ||
|| /context/package1/books/save              || app.controllers.package1.!BooksController              || save             ||    ||
|| /context/package1/books/save/123          || app.controllers.package1.!BooksController              || save             ||  123||
|| /context/package1/package2/books          || app.controllers.package1.package2.!BooksController     || index            ||   ||
|| /context/package1/package2/books/save     || app.controllers.package1.package2.!BooksController     || save             ||    ||
|| /context/package1/package2/books/save/123 || app.controllers.package1.package2.!BooksController     || save             ||  123||

RESTful routing supports sub-packaging exactly the same as standard. 

==Mapping paths to controller names==

When matching a path to a controller class, !ActiveWeb converts a name of a controller from underscore or hyphenated format to !CamelCase:
|| *path*                                      || *controller*                             || 
|| /context/books                            || app.controllers.package1.!BooksController         ||
|| /context/student_books                    || app.controllers.package1.!StudentBooksController  ||
|| /context/student-books                    || app.controllers.package1.!StudentBooksController  ||
