#summary all about views for ActiveWeb developer

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

Views in !ActiveWeb are also called templates. They are located in the following directory:
{{{
 ..src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views
}}}

=No JSPs=

!ActiveWeb does not use JSPs. The main reason for not using JSPs is inability to test generated HTML with JSPs in a unit test. While the first implementation of !ActiveWeb used JSPs as the rendering engine, as soon as we started implementing the [Testing] framework, we quickly realized that this is simply impossible with JSPs. Generating HTML from a JUnit test is simply impossible and would be time consuming. Besides, the number of problems with different versions of JSP and JSTL specifications would be a nightmare to maintain. Thus we made a hard choice early on in 2010 to not use JSPs all together. In the long run this has proven to be a good decision, it is possible to write very thorough tests with ActiveWeb that is impossible with any Java technology relying on JSPs. 

=!ActiveWeb uses !FreeMarker=
!ActiveWeb uses !FreeMarker as a templating engine. please see [FAQ#Why_FreeMarker_?] for more information. 

!ActiveWeb has a pluggable architecture that allows to integrate any other engine, such as Velocity or any other, as long as they can implement [http://code.google.com/p/activeweb/source/browse/trunk/activeweb/src/main/java/activeweb/TemplateManager.java TempalteManager] interface.
