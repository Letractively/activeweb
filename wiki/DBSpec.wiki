 2.  public void init(AppContext context) {
 3.      environment("development").jndi("jdbc/kitchensink_development");
 4.      environment("development").testing().jdbc("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://localhost/kitchensink_development", "root", "****");
 5.      environment("hudson").testing().jdbc("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://172.30.64.31/kitchensink_hudson", "root", "****");
 6.      environment("production").jndi("jdbc/kitchensink_production");
 7.  }
