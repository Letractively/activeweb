#summary how to evolve your database schema

= Database Migrations =

!ActiveWeb projects' databases evolve similar to how this is done in Ruby on Rails projects. However, there are some differences too. 

Please, see [http://code.google.com/p/activejdbc/wiki/DBMigrations DBMigrations] on ActiveJDBC wiki to understand the migration process. This process would be the same whether you use ActiveJDBC or any other database  technology.

This process is our recommendation based on experience. There is no hard dependency of !ActiveWeb on this process.
